# xai4cv.github.io

This website was created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To run it follow the instructions below:

1. Install node's latest version (preferably through [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)).
2. Install yarn through `npm install -g yarn`
3. Clone the repository and run `yarn install` in it.
4. Ensure that you are on the `source` branch of the repository and all your code changes happen on the `source` branch.
5. Run `yarn start` to test the website locally.
6. For deployment on github run `yarn deploy`. Note that this repository's default code branch is `source` and you should run the deploy command when you are on the `source` branch. The deployment command will make changes to the `master` branch. Note that you never have to manually make any changes to the `master` branch, yarn will make all the changes for you.
